This blog will give a very brief introduction and background of the Majorana zero modes and way to obtain them in a simple model known as the Kitaev Chain. The aim will be to translate the Kitaev Chain Hamiltonian into a Matrix form to obtain energy spectrum and edge modes for an open chain. We will obtain these Majorana zero modes at the edges of an open chain.\nMajorana Fermions In the year 1937, a new class of particles that are its own anti-particles were hypothesized by Ettore Majorana. This new class were termed Majorana fermions or particles for obvious reasons. They can be mathematically represented by creation and anhilation operators in second quantization:\n $$\\gamma^\\dagger_k = \\gamma_k$$ where, $\\gamma_k$: anhilates a particle in quantum state k; $\\gamma_k^\\dagger$: creates a particle in quantum state k\n The equation above conveys that the operators for creating and destroying the particles are same, which is the desired property of the Majorana in contrast to Dirac fermions for which they are distinct. The above operators shall be referred as Majorana operators. There are several conventions to define these Majorana operators. We will be adopting the following($f$ is the fermionic operator):\n \\begin{align} f^\\dagger = (\\gamma_1 + i\\gamma_2)/2 \\nonumber \\qquad f = (\\gamma_1 - i\\gamma_2)/2 \\label{2} \\end{align}\n Using this definition, the following identities can be checked\n $\\gamma_k^2 = 1$ $\\left[\\gamma_i,\\gamma_j\\right] = 2\\delta_{ij}$  There have been lot of attempts in experimental high energy physics to hunt these particles.\nMajorana Zero Modes Let\u0026rsquo;s shift gears and enter the realm of condensed matter physics. In superconducting materials, certain quasiparticle(Bogoliubov) excitations display similar properties as that of Majorana fermions. The Majorana zero mode(MZM) is a special case of Bogoliubov quasiparticle operators which are linear combinations of electron and hole operator. The MZM satisfy the properties that they square to identity and are self-Hermitian.\nIf we look carefully at above equations, the two Majorana modes always occurs in pair for a single fermionic mode. Can we decouple them? This was cleverly answered by Professor Alexei Kitaev in 2001, through his Kitaev chain, which is a 1D p-wave superconducting model.\nKitaev Chain Kitaev Chain is a tight binding lattice model of spinless electrons with nearest-neighbour hopping amplitude $t$, a p-wave superconducting pairing term $\\Delta$ for nearest neighbours and on-site chemical potential $\\mu$. The hamiltonian for a finite and open chain in second quantization can be jotted down \\begin{equation} \\hat{H} = \\sum_{n=1}^{N-1}\\left[t\\left(f_n^\\dagger f_{n+1} + f_{n+1}^\\dagger f_n\\right) + \\Delta\\left(f_n f_{n+1} + f_{n+1}^\\dagger f_n^\\dagger\\right)\\right] - \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\mu \\left( 2f_n^\\dagger f_n - 1 \\right) \\label{real_space_Hamiltonian} \\end{equation} where $t,\\Delta$ and $\\mu$ are all real and $\\gamma \u0026gt; 0$ without loss of generality. Similar to the definition above, we define the following Majorana operators \\begin{align} a_{2n-1} = f_n + f_n^\\dagger \\quad \\text{and} \\quad a_{2n} = i(f_n - f_n^\\dagger) \\label{4} \\end{align} for n = 1,2,\u0026hellip;,N. The Kitaev Chain Hamiltonian can be rewritten in terms of these Majorana operators \\begin{equation} \\hat{H} = i\\sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \\left[J_xa_{2n}a_{2n+1} - J_ya_{2n-1} a_{2n+2}\\right] + i\\sum_{n=1}^{N}\\mu a_{2n-1}a_{2n} \\end{equation} where, $J_x = \\frac{1}{2}(t - \\Delta) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad J_y = \\frac{1}{2}(t + \\Delta)$\nLet us carefully examine the Hamiltonian in the Majorana basis. A brief look will help us solve the problem of decoupling. Let us look at two special cases in the parameter space of $t, \\Delta$ and $\\mu$.\nCase I: $t = \\Delta$ and $\\mu = 0$\nThe conditions clearly imply $J_x=0$ and $J_y=t$ which results in \\begin{equation} \\hat{H} = -i\\sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \\left[t a_{2n-1} a_{2n+2}\\right] \\label{6} \\end{equation}\n Did we end up finding something interesting? A close attention to the equation above reveals that the even(odd) Majorana mode at the left(right) end has vanished and it is decoupled from the rest of the modes. This is exactly what we set out for! The unpaired Majorana modes.\n Case II: $t = -\\Delta$ and $\\mu = 0$\nThis time $J_y = 0$ and $J_x = t$ which results in \\begin{equation} \\hat{H} = i\\sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \\left[t a_{2n}a_{2n+1}\\right] \\end{equation}\n This time, the odd(even) Majorana mode at the left(right) end of the chain is unpaired with the rest of the chain.\n Wonderful! We know a way to obtain the unpaired Majorana end modes. Let us test this out through a Python Snippet!\nLet us import the necessary Python modules import numpy as np\t# Numerical computation import numpy.linalg as la\t# Linear Algebra import matplotlib as mp\t# Generating plots import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.style.use('seaborn')\t# Setting the plotting style mp.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (9, 7) # Setting the size of the plots %matplotlib notebook\t# Inline plotting  Let us define the various parameters of the system Nsites = 25 # Number of lattice sites Nprime = 2*Nsites e_threshold = 1E-6\t# Threshold for finding zero eigenstates params = { 't' : 2.0, # Nearest neighbor hopping 'Delta' : 2.0, # Superconducting pairing term 'mu' : 0.0 # Chemical potential }  We define the Kitaev Chain Hamiltonian in the Majorana basis def kitaev_ham(Nsites,params): Hmat = np.zeros([Nprime,Nprime])\t# Declare a 2Nx2N matrix Jx = 0.5*(params['t'] - params['Delta'])\tJy = 0.5*(params['t'] + params['Delta']) for n in range(Nsites-1): Hmat[2*n,2*n+1] = Jx Hmat[2*n+1,2*n] = -Jx Hmat[2*n-1,2*n+2] = -Jy Hmat[2*n+2,2*n-1] = Jy Hmat[2*n-1,2*n] = params['mu'] Hmat[2*n,2*n-1] = -params['mu'] Hmat[2*(Nsites-1)-1,2*(Nsites-1)] = params['mu'] Hmat[2*(Nsites-1),2*(Nsites-1)-1] = -params['mu'] Hmat = 1j*Hmat return Hmat  Now that we have defined our Hamiltonian in a Matrix representation, let us visualise it.\nVisualize the Hamiltonian Matrix def visualise_mat(Hmat): plt.imshow(Hmat.imag) # The real part of the matrix is a zero matrix plt.colorbar() plt.show()  We have fixed the system parameters such that we realise case I. Let us see if we get any zero energy modes.\nDiagonalise the Hamiltonian matrix and plot the spectrum def plot_spectrum(Hmat): evals,evecs = la.eigh(Hmat) evals = evals.real plt.scatter(np.arange(len(evals)),evals) plt.title('Energy Spectrum of Chain with {} Sites'.format(Nsites)) plt.show() plot_spectrum(kitaev_ham(Nsites,params))  Hurray! We do see two energy modes at zero energy. Rest of the spectrum lies above and below the zero energy and also well separated. We can take it further and verify if the eigenvectors corresponding to these zero energy modes are localised at the edges of the chain.\nCheck for zero energy modes # Extract the indices of energy modes close to zero def check_zeromodes(evals): nzmodes = 0 zmodes_ind = np.where(abs(evals) \u0026lt;= e_threshold)[0] return zmodes_ind,len(zmodes_ind)  Plot the probability distribution of the Majorana zero modes(edge modes) def plot_zeromodes(evals,evecs,params): param_info = '\\n'.join(( r'$\\mu=%.2f$' % (params['mu']), r'$t=%.2f$' % (params['t']), r'$\\Delta=%.2f$' % (params['Delta']))) zmodes_ind,cnt_zmodes = check_zeromodes(evals) if cnt_zmodes \u0026gt; 0: fig,ax = plt.subplots(1,cnt_zmodes,figsize=(20, 10)) fig.suptitle('Probability distribution of Zero modes',fontsize=20, fontweight='bold') for cnt in range(cnt_zmodes): ax1 = ax[cnt] ax1.plot(np.abs(evecs[:,zmodes_ind[cnt]])**2) ax1.set_title('Edge mode {}'.format(cnt+1),fontsize=20) ax1.set_xlabel('Site Number',fontsize=20) ax1.set_ylabel('$|\\psi|^2$',fontsize=20) ax1.text(0.43, 0.95, param_info, transform=ax1.transAxes, fontsize=16, verticalalignment='top', bbox=dict(boxstyle=\u0026quot;square\u0026quot;,facecolor=\u0026quot;white\u0026quot;)) ax1.tick_params(axis='both', which='major', labelsize=16) #plt.savefig('Edge_modes_Kitaev.pdf') plt.show() evals,evecs = la.eigh((kitaev_ham(Nsites,params))) plot_zeromodes(evals,evecs,params)  Indeed, we see that wavefunction($|\\psi|^2$ to be precise) corresponding to these zero energy modes are localised at the edges of the chain. We can also repeat the same exercise for Case II.\nWonderful! We know a way to obtain the unpaired Majorana end modes. The Majorana modes in the each case have zero energy and are localised at the end of the chain. Thus, it makes sense to coin the term, Majorana zero modes(MZMs). It is fascinating that the MZMs appear when tweaking the parameters! However, there might be some skepticism here as we obtained MZMs at a very special points in the parameter space. Let us vary the parameters of our system and check the fate of these zero energy modes.\nvar_mu = np.linspace(0,4,101) var_energy = np.zeros([len(var_mu),Nprime]) for i in range(len(var_mu)): var_energy[i] = la.eigh(kitaev_ham(Nsites,params = {'t' : 2.0,'Delta' : 2.0, 'mu' : var_mu[i]}))[0] plt.title(\u0026quot;Energy Spectrum as a function of $\\mu/t$ (N = 15)\u0026quot;) for i in range(Nprime): plt.plot(var_mu,var_energy[:,i]) plt.ylabel('Energy') plt.xlabel('$\\mu/t$') plt.show()  It is a very interesting result. The zero energy modes exist even when we tweak the chemical potential. In other words, the MZMs don\u0026rsquo;t just appear by just fine tuning to a special parameter values but isolated MZMs stay protected as long as the bulk gap is finite. The reason behind this exciting observation is due to a concept known as Symmetry Protected Topological Phases(SPTP) which is a story for some other blog.

I am following \u0026lsquo;The Oxford Solid state Basics\u0026rsquo; book by Prof. Steven H. Simon. If the material covered is unclear, please refer the book suggested above. In any case, go through that book. It is a lovely book to read!\nHistorical note: It was well known that the heat capacity per atom for a solid is given by $C \\approx 3k_B$ or in other terms, molar heat capacity is $C \\approx 3R$, where $R$ is the Universal gas constant. This empirical observation was known as Dulong-Petit Law.\nLet us look at heat capacities for different chemicals at room temperature($T = 25^oC$)1:\nThe above figure shows the heat capacities for various chemical elements at a temperature of 25 $^0C$ and a pressure of 100kPa. It is evident that most of them follow Dulong-Petit Law.\nHow do we explain this empirical observation? The answer was provided by Boltzmann using classical statistical mechanics. We will take his approach and understand the source of this empirical law.\nBoltzmann approach: Classical Statistical Mechanics The key idea in his approach was to assume atoms inside a solid to be in a harmonic potential under the influence of neighbouring atoms: Imagine the same model with chain of such atoms forming a solid in 3 spatial dimensions(3D) at a fixed temperature T. Now, the Hamiltonian for each atom can be written as: $$ \\mathcal{H}(\\mathbf{q},\\mathbf{p}) = \\frac{\\mathbf{p}^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2\\mathbf{q}^2$$\n Note:\n We assumed the spring constant to be same in all three dimensions. Quantities $\\mathbf{p}$ and $\\mathbf{q}$ are three dimensional vectors.   Since we have a large collection of such atoms at a fixed temperature T, we can find its energy and heat constant using classical canonical partition function. The single-particle partition function is given by, $$ Z_1 = \\frac{1}{h^3}\\int\\int e^{-\\beta \\mathcal{H}(\\mathbf{q},\\mathbf{p})}d\\mathbf{q}d\\mathbf{p}$$\nWe shall explicitly evaluate this quantity. It will be handy to recall the Gaussian integral of one variable: $$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-ax^2}dx = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{a}}$$\nLet us get our hands dirty!\n$$Z_1 = \\frac{1}{h^3}\\int\\int e^{-\\beta(\\frac{\\mathbf{p}^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2\\mathbf{q}^2)}d\\mathbf{q}d\\mathbf{p} \\ = \\frac{1}{h^3} \\int exp{\\frac{-\\beta\\mathbf{p}^2}{2m}} d\\mathbf{p} \\int exp{\\frac{-\\beta m\\omega^2}{2}\\mathbf{q}^2} d\\mathbf{q} $$\nWe can further separate the 3D integral into a product of three 1D integrals in both momentum and position coordinates.\n$$ \\begin{align} Z_1 = \\frac{1}{h^3} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} exp{\\frac{-\\beta{p_x}^2}{2m}} dp_x \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} exp{\\frac{-\\beta{p_y}^2}{2m}} dp_y \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} exp{\\frac{-\\beta{p_z}^2}{2m}} dp_z \\\\\\ \\text{x} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} exp{\\frac{-\\beta m\\omega^2q_x^2}{2}} dq_x \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} exp{\\frac{-\\beta m\\omega^2q_y^2}{2}} dq_y \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} exp{\\frac{-\\beta m\\omega^2q_z^2}{2}} dq_z \\end{align} $$\n$$= \\frac{1}{h^3} \\left[\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} exp{\\frac{-\\beta{p_x}^2}{2m}} dp_x\\right]^3 \\left[\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} exp{\\frac{-\\beta m\\omega^2q_x^2}{2}} dq_x\\right]^3$$ Using the 1D Gaussian integrals above, we get\n$$ Z_1 = \\frac{1}{h^3} \\left[\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi m}{\\beta}}\\right]^3 \\left[\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta m \\omega^2}} \\right]^3 = \\left[\\frac{k_B T}{\\hbar\\omega}\\right]^3$$ where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $\\hbar = h/2\\pi$. The N particle partition function can be obtained by assuming that the particles are distinguishable: $$Z_N = [Z_1]^N = \\left[\\frac{k_B T}{\\hbar\\omega}\\right]^{3N}$$\nWe know, from the connection to thermodynamic quantities, the internal energy of this system can be obtained by $$ E = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\beta}lnZ_N = 3Nk_BT$$\nThus, the heat capacity per atom is $$C_v = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\frac{E}{N} = 3k_B$$\nHooray! We have obtained our result of $3k_B$ for the specific heat. Boltzmann\u0026rsquo;s idea worked and we can now explain this empirical observation. Thus, Boltzmann accounted lattice vibrations as the source for the heat capacity and modelled it classically as masses connected by a spring.\nIs it the end of the story? Even the graph above will tell you that there are outliers to this empirical law. Particularly, heat capacity of diamond deviates from Dulong-Petit law at room temperatures. Also, heat capacity strongly depends on temperature, and becomes smaller at lower temperatures(Apparently room temperature is a \u0026ldquo;low\u0026rdquo; temperature for diamond). What are we missing here? Einstein came up with a brilliant idea to consider quantum mechanics as the key here.\nEinstein\u0026rsquo;s approach: Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Einstein followed a similar approach to that of Boltzmann except, he used quantized harmonic oscillator levels for each atom, given by $$\\epsilon_n = \\hbar \\omega(n+3/2)$$\nwhere $n = n_x+n_y+n_z$. The partition function in this case in given by: $$ \\begin{align} Z_1 \u0026amp;= \\sum_{n_x,n_y,n_z\\geq0}e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_n} = \\sum_{n_x,n_y,n_z\\geq0}e^{-\\beta \\hbar \\omega(n_x+n_y+n_z+3/2)} \\\\\\\n\u0026amp;= e^{-3\\beta \\hbar\\omega/2}\\sum_{n_x\\geq0}e^{-\\beta\\hbar\\omega n_x} \\sum_{n_y\\geq0}e^{-\\beta\\hbar\\omega n_y} \\sum_{n_z\\geq0}e^{-\\beta\\hbar\\omega n_z} \\end{align} $$\nEach sum represents a geometric series and thus reduces to $$ Z_1 = \\left(\\frac{e^{-\\beta \\hbar\\omega/2}}{1-e^{\\beta \\hbar\\omega}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{e^{-\\beta \\hbar\\omega/2}}{1-e^{\\beta \\hbar\\omega}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{e^{-\\beta \\hbar\\omega/2}}{1-e^{\\beta \\hbar\\omega}}\\right) = \\left[\\frac{1}{2sinh(\\beta\\hbar\\omega/2)}\\right]^3$$\nThe N particle partitions function is thus given as $$Z_N = \\left[\\frac{1}{2sinh(\\beta\\hbar\\omega/2)}\\right]^{3N}$$\nand energy $$ E = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\beta}lnZ_N = 3N\\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{2}coth\\left(\\beta\\hbar\\omega/2\\right) = 3N\\hbar\\omega\\left(n_B(\\beta\\hbar\\omega) + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 3NE_1$$\nwhere $n_B(x) = \\frac{1}{e^{x}-1}$ is the Bose occupation factor. The quantity $E_1$ stands for energy of a single harmonic oscillator in 1D and it can be interpreted as $n_B$ bosonic modes of energy $\\hbar \\omega$ are occupied.\nThe heat capacity per atom can be similarly obtained as above: $$C_v = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\frac{E}{N} = 3k_B(\\beta\\hbar\\omega)^2\\frac{e^{\\beta\\hbar\\omega}}{(e^{\\beta\\hbar\\omega}-1)^2}$$\n Obervation: The plot on the left tells us that lower energy modes have higher occupation than the higher energy modes. The plot on the right gives us the energy as a function of time. It shows us that as $K_BT\\ll\\hbar\\omega$, the heat capacity, which is the slope, tends to zero.\n This can be further verified by explicitly working out the heat capacity per atom: $$C_v = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\frac{E}{N} = 3k_B(\\beta\\hbar\\omega)^2\\frac{e^{\\beta\\hbar\\omega}}{(e^{\\beta\\hbar\\omega}-1)^2}$$\nThe expression above might not be intuitive at first sight. We can check whether we obtain Dulong-Petit law in the high temperature limit: $K_BT \\gg \\hbar \\omega$ $$ \\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{K_BT} \\ll 1 \\implies \\text{exp}(\\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{K_BT}) \\approx 1 \\ \\implies (e^{\\beta\\hbar\\omega}-1) \\approx \\beta\\hbar\\omega \\quad(\\text{using Taylor expansion of exponential}) $$\nUsing these approximations, the high-temperature asymptotic behaviour of heat capacity reduces to $C = 3K_B$. We have managed to recover Dulong-Petit Law!\nSimilarly, we can obtain the low temperature limit: $K_BT \\ll \\hbar \\omega$ $$ \\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{K_BT} \\gg 1 \\implies \\text{exp}(\\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{K_BT}) \\gg 1 \\\n\\implies (e^{\\beta\\hbar\\omega}-1) \\approx \\text{exp}(\\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{K_BT}) $$ Using these approximations, the low-temperature asymptotic behaviour of heat capacity reduces to $$ C_v = 3k_B(\\beta\\hbar\\omega)^2e^{-\\beta\\hbar\\omega} $$\nWe see that heat capacity drops exponentially as we lower the temperature. All our findings, can be captured by plotting heat capacity as a function of temperature:\nThis exponential drop can be understood by looking at the energy spectrum of each atom. As we lower the temperature below the characteristic energy, i.e., $k_BT \u0026lt; \\hbar\\omega$, all atoms start occupying the ground state or low lying states according Bose distribution. Since the spectrum is discrete, the thermal energy is not enough to keep them in higher states and energy drop is higher(exponential).\nThus, the Einstein\u0026rsquo;s model qualitatively captures the low temperature behaviour of heat capacity in solids. Let us look at how it performs quantitatively and compares with a experimental data.\n  https://solidstate.quantumtinkerer.tudelft.nl/1_einstein_model/ \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1595462400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595462400,"objectID":"1dfc0310e1be8127d82fd7b8fea6db5f","permalink":"/notes_pages/ssphysics/heat_capacity/","publishdate":"2020-07-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/notes_pages/ssphysics/heat_capacity/","section":"notes_pages","summary":"In this parts of the notes, we will try to understand the historical evolution in trying to explain the heat capacity of solids.
