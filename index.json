I am following \u0026lsquo;The Oxford Solid state Basics\u0026rsquo; book by Prof. Steven H. Simon. If the material covered is unclear, please refer the book suggested above. In any case, go through that book. It is a lovely book to read!\nHistorical note: It was well known that the heat capacity per atom for a solid is given by $C \\approx 3k_B$ or in other terms, molar heat capacity is $C \\approx 3R$, where $R$ is the Universal gas constant. This empirical observation was known as Dulong-Petit Law.\nLet us look at heat capacities for different chemicals at room temperature($T = 25^oC$)1:\nThe above figure shows the heat capacities for various chemical elements at a temperature of 25 $^0C$ and a pressure of 100kPa. It is evident that most of them follow Dulong-Petit Law.\nHow do we explain this empirical observation? The answer was provided by Boltzmann using classical statistical mechanics. We will take his approach and understand the source of this empirical law.\nBoltzmann approach: Classical Statistical Mechanics The key idea in his approach was to assume atoms inside a solid to be in a harmonic potential under the influence of neighbouring atoms: Imagine the same model with chain of such atoms forming a solid in 3 spatial dimensions(3D) at a fixed temperature T. Now, the Hamiltonian for each atom can be written as: $$ \\mathcal{H}(\\mathbf{q},\\mathbf{p}) = \\frac{\\mathbf{p}^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2\\mathbf{q}^2$$\n Note:\n We assumed the spring constant to be same in all three dimensions. Quantities $\\mathbf{p}$ and $\\mathbf{q}$ are three dimensional vectors.   Since we have a large collection of such atoms at a fixed temperature T, we can find its energy and heat constant using classical canonical partition function. The single-particle partition function is given by, $$ Z_1 = \\frac{1}{h^3}\\int\\int e^{-\\beta \\mathcal{H}(\\mathbf{q},\\mathbf{p})}d\\mathbf{q}d\\mathbf{p}$$\nWe shall explicitly evaluate this quantity. It will be handy to recall the Gaussian integral of one variable: $$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-ax^2}dx = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{a}}$$\nLet us get our hands dirty!\n$$Z_1 = \\frac{1}{h^3}\\int\\int e^{-\\beta(\\frac{\\mathbf{p}^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2\\mathbf{q}^2)}d\\mathbf{q}d\\mathbf{p} \\ = \\frac{1}{h^3} \\int exp{\\frac{-\\beta\\mathbf{p}^2}{2m}} d\\mathbf{p} \\int exp{\\frac{-\\beta m\\omega^2}{2}\\mathbf{q}^2} d\\mathbf{q} $$\nWe can further separate the 3D integral into a product of three 1D integrals in both momentum and position coordinates.\n$$ \\begin{align} Z_1 = \\frac{1}{h^3} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} exp{\\frac{-\\beta{p_x}^2}{2m}} dp_x \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} exp{\\frac{-\\beta{p_y}^2}{2m}} dp_y \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} exp{\\frac{-\\beta{p_z}^2}{2m}} dp_z \\\\\\ \\text{x} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} exp{\\frac{-\\beta m\\omega^2q_x^2}{2}} dq_x \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} exp{\\frac{-\\beta m\\omega^2q_y^2}{2}} dq_y \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} exp{\\frac{-\\beta m\\omega^2q_z^2}{2}} dq_z \\end{align} $$\n$$= \\frac{1}{h^3} \\left[\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} exp{\\frac{-\\beta{p_x}^2}{2m}} dp_x\\right]^3 \\left[\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} exp{\\frac{-\\beta m\\omega^2q_x^2}{2}} dq_x\\right]^3$$ Using the 1D Gaussian integrals above, we get\n$$ Z_1 = \\frac{1}{h^3} \\left[\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi m}{\\beta}}\\right]^3 \\left[\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta m \\omega^2}} \\right]^3 = \\left[\\frac{k_B T}{\\hbar\\omega}\\right]^3$$ where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $\\hbar = h/2\\pi$. The N particle partition function can be obtained by assuming that the particles are distinguishable: $$Z_N = [Z_1]^N = \\left[\\frac{k_B T}{\\hbar\\omega}\\right]^{3N}$$\nWe know, from the connection to thermodynamic quantities, the internal energy of this system can be obtained by $$ E = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\beta}lnZ_N = 3Nk_BT$$\nThus, the heat capacity per atom is $$C_v = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\frac{E}{N} = 3k_B$$\nHooray! We have obtained our result of $3k_B$ for the specific heat. Boltzmann\u0026rsquo;s idea worked and we can now explain this empirical observation. Thus, Boltzmann accounted lattice vibrations as the source for the heat capacity and modelled it classically as masses connected by a spring.\nIs it the end of the story? Even the graph above will tell you that there are outliers to this empirical law. Particularly, heat capacity of diamond deviates from Dulong-Petit law at room temperatures. Also, heat capacity strongly depends on temperature, and becomes smaller at lower temperatures(Apparently room temperature is a \u0026ldquo;low\u0026rdquo; temperature for diamond). What are we missing here? Einstein came up with a brilliant idea to consider quantum mechanics as the key here.\nEinstein\u0026rsquo;s approach: Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Einstein followed a similar approach to that of Boltzmann except, he used quantized harmonic oscillator levels for each atom, given by $$\\epsilon_n = \\hbar \\omega(n+3/2)$$\nwhere $n = n_x+n_y+n_z$. The partition function in this case in given by: $$ \\begin{align} Z_1 \u0026amp;= \\sum_{n_x,n_y,n_z\\geq0}e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_n} = \\sum_{n_x,n_y,n_z\\geq0}e^{-\\beta \\hbar \\omega(n_x+n_y+n_z+3/2)} \\\\\\\n\u0026amp;= e^{-3\\beta \\hbar\\omega/2}\\sum_{n_x\\geq0}e^{-\\beta\\hbar\\omega n_x} \\sum_{n_y\\geq0}e^{-\\beta\\hbar\\omega n_y} \\sum_{n_z\\geq0}e^{-\\beta\\hbar\\omega n_z} \\end{align} $$\nEach sum represents a geometric series and thus reduces to $$ Z_1 = \\left(\\frac{e^{-\\beta \\hbar\\omega/2}}{1-e^{\\beta \\hbar\\omega}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{e^{-\\beta \\hbar\\omega/2}}{1-e^{\\beta \\hbar\\omega}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{e^{-\\beta \\hbar\\omega/2}}{1-e^{\\beta \\hbar\\omega}}\\right) = \\left[\\frac{1}{2sinh(\\beta\\hbar\\omega/2)}\\right]^3$$\nThe N particle partitions function is thus given as $$Z_N = \\left[\\frac{1}{2sinh(\\beta\\hbar\\omega/2)}\\right]^{3N}$$\nand energy $$ E = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\beta}lnZ_N = 3N\\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{2}coth\\left(\\beta\\hbar\\omega/2\\right) = 3N\\hbar\\omega\\left(n_B(\\beta\\hbar\\omega) + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 3NE_1$$\nwhere $n_B(x) = \\frac{1}{e^{x}-1}$ is the Bose occupation factor. The quantity $E_1$ stands for energy of a single harmonic oscillator in 1D and it can be interpreted as $n_B$ bosonic modes of energy $\\hbar \\omega$ are occupied.\nThe heat capacity per atom can be similarly obtained as above: $$C_v = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\frac{E}{N} = 3k_B(\\beta\\hbar\\omega)^2\\frac{e^{\\beta\\hbar\\omega}}{(e^{\\beta\\hbar\\omega}-1)^2}$$\n  https://solidstate.quantumtinkerer.tudelft.nl/1_einstein_model/ \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1595462400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595462400,"objectID":"1dfc0310e1be8127d82fd7b8fea6db5f","permalink":"/notes_pages/ssphysics/heat_capacity/","publishdate":"2020-07-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/notes_pages/ssphysics/heat_capacity/","section":"notes_pages","summary":"In this parts of the notes, we will try to understand the historical evolution in trying to explain the heat capacity of solids.
